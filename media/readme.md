## 🚀 Rover Design Update

![IMG\_9788](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8b5f6ba-8b9f-4258-8728-7bc07474a053)

**New rover design compared to our previous iteration.**

### 🔧 Key Improvements

* 🧱 **More robust chassis** for improved structural rigidity
* ⚙️ **Improved drivetrain layout** for better power transfer and reliability
* ⛓️ **Chain-driven excavation mechanism** for consistent material handling
* 🦾 **Integrated linear actuator system** for controlled excavation motion
* 🔩 **Improved serviceability and accessibility** for debugging and maintenance

These updates were implemented based on **lessons learned from the earlier rover design**, with a focus on durability and competition readiness.

## 🧰 Previous Rover Design

![old_rover_design](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df4396d6-84d2-44a3-b48b-cd9e321dac3c)

**Earlier rover design used prior to the current iteration.**

### ⚙️ Characteristics

* 🧊 **Compact aluminum frame** with enclosed electronics bay
* 🛞 **Direct-drive wheel configuration** without an integrated excavation system
* 🧠 **Electronics-first layout**, focused on initial control and communication testing
* 🧪 **Prototype platform** for validating motor control, power distribution, and ESP32-based firmware
* 🔍 **Limited serviceability**, which informed improvements in the newer design

This version served as a **proof-of-concept platform**, helping identify mechanical, electrical, and software limitations that directly influenced the improvements made in the current rover design.
