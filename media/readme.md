New rover design compared to our previous iteration.
This updated design features a more robust chassis, improved drivetrain layout, and an integrated chain-driven excavation and linear actuator system. The changes were made to improve structural rigidity, serviceability, and overall reliability based on lessons learned from the earlier rover design.
